#Front End Assignment

![](ss1.png?raw=true)


This assignment was done as a techinal test for a front end role. The instructions i was given are as follows:

Create a basic photo ordering tool based on the images and JavaScript included. Thumbnails of the images should display in the order dictated by the include using a grid-based layout, and should be reorder-able by dragging the images to their desired position.
This should be a completely client-side exercise. Server code to store the new photo order isn’t necessary.
While the use of libraries is permitted for basic DOM manipulation or event handling, it’s expected that the core content should be original.
Code should be optimised for Chrome. Support for other browsers is not necessary.
Extra points for style.
