Create a basic photo ordering tool based on the images and JavaScript included. Thumbnails of the images should display in the order dictated by the include using a grid-based layout, and should be reorder-able by dragging the images to their desired position.
This should be a completely client-side exercise. Server code to store the new photo order isn’t necessary.
While the use of libraries is permitted for basic DOM manipulation or event handling, it’s expected that the core content should be original.
Code should be optimised for Chrome. Support for other browsers is not necessary.
Extra points for style.

##About
I started the assignment by taking a look at some websites which use drag and drop to get a feel for what i had to do. Follwiing this i created an HTML document and put the images in as a list. I did some basic styling at this point just so i could get my head around what i was working with before starting work on the javascript. Finally i worked on creating a grid layout using css and then added some final touches to the styling. 

If i were to spend further time on this project i would spend more time looking at the Javascript. At the moment I can only drag and drop the pictures if they are dragged from the border of the image not the image itself. I also encountered a similar issue if the picture is dropped on the picture itself as opposed to the pictures border.
